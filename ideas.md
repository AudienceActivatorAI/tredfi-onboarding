  **Design Movement**: **Modern Professional / Clean Corporate**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Clarity & Trust**: The primary goal is to make the user feel secure and guided.
  2. **Efficiency**: The form should feel quick and easy to complete.
  3. **Professionalism**: Reflects a high-end B2B service.
  **Color Philosophy**: Deep Navy Blue (#0A2540) as the primary color to convey stability and trust, accented with a vibrant Teal (#00D4FF) for calls to action to suggest forward momentum and technology. White backgrounds with subtle gray sections to break up content.
  **Layout Paradigm**: A centered, single-column card layout for the form itself, floating above a subtle, abstract geometric background. This focuses attention entirely on the questions.
  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Progress Bar**: A sleek, segmented progress indicator at the top.
  2. **Card Elevation**: Soft, deep shadows on the form container to lift it off the page.
  3. **Clean Icons**: Simple, outlined icons for each section (CRM, DMS, etc.) to add visual interest without clutter.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth transitions between form steps. Input fields should highlight clearly upon focus. "Not applicable" options should be easy-to-click toggles or checkboxes that instantly disable the input.
  **Animation**: Subtle fade-ins for each new question. The progress bar fills smoothly. Success state is a gentle checkmark animation.
  **Typography System**: **Inter** for UI elements (labels, buttons) for maximum readability, paired with **Merriweather** for headings to add a touch of established authority and warmth.

  **Design Movement**: **Automotive Tech / Dark Mode Sleek**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Innovation**: Tredfi is a cutting-edge tech partner.
  2. **Speed**: The interface should feel fast and responsive.
  3. **Premium**: Like a luxury car dashboard.
  **Color Philosophy**: Dark Charcoal (#121212) background with high-contrast White text. Accents in "Sports Car Red" (#E63946) or "Electric Blue" (#4361EE) to guide the eye. This mimics the interior of a modern vehicle or a high-tech software suite.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Split screen. Left side contains the form questions, right side (or top on mobile) features a dynamic, high-quality 3D abstract automotive visualization or a reassuring message from the "assistant" that updates as they progress.
  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glassmorphism**: Semi-transparent panels for form sections.
  2. **Neon Glows**: Subtle glow effects on active input fields.
  3. **Speedometer-style Progress**: A circular or gauge-style progress indicator.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Snappy, instant feedback. Inputs feel like cockpit controls.
  **Animation**: Slide-in animations for questions. Hover effects that brighten elements.
  **Typography System**: **Rajdhani** or **Exo 2** for headings (square, tech-focused), paired with **Roboto** for body text.

  **Design Movement**: **Warm Partnership / Human-Centric**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Welcoming**: The user is starting a relationship, not just a process.
  2. **Supportive**: Help is always visible.
  3. **Approachable**: Removes the intimidation of "setup."
  **Color Philosophy**: Soft Warm Beige (#F5F5F0) background. Primary color is a calming Sage Green (#4A7C59) or Terracotta (#E07A5F) to feel organic and grounded. Text is a soft Dark Brown (#3D3D3D) rather than harsh black.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric layout. The form flows down the page with ample whitespace. "Help" tips or friendly explanations appear in a sidebar or margin next to relevant questions, conversational in tone.
  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Illustration**: Custom, friendly flat-style illustrations of people working together or abstract "connection" graphics.
  2. **Rounded Corners**: heavily rounded buttons and inputs (pill shapes).
  3. **Conversational Labels**: Instead of "CRM Name", use "Which CRM do you use?".
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Gentle, reassuring. Error messages are helpful prompts, not warnings.
  **Animation**: Soft bounces and eases. Elements float into place.
  **Typography System**: **Nunito** or **Quicksand** (rounded sans-serif) for headings to feel friendly, paired with **Lato** for body text.
